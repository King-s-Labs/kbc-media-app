# Instructions ~ Lorenzo

I did this all on Mac so if you're using Windows you may need to run different commands or install different versions.


## Installation

Install these:

node - https://nodejs.org/en/download

on your phone ->
ExpoGo (So you can run the development server on your device)

ReactNativePaper (An app that lets you see the different components for the component library I added to the project)

Once you clone the project from github, run these commands

```bash
  cd KBC_Media_App # make sure you are in the second directory called this
  npm install
  npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code on your device and it should open in ExpoGo (Might be different if you have an android) 
OR
Run simulation on your computer by pressing the respective key mentioned in the console when you run the Expo App.
